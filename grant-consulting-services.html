Alternate Canadian corporations like partnerships, public companies, trusts, and more, can receive tax incentives that equate to 20 percent of eligible expenses for SR&ED conducted within Canadian borders. <br><br>  The Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED, SRED, pronounced “SHRED”) program provides compensation to offset eligible expenses incurred by businesses in Canada. Scientific Research & Experimental Development claims are a complex tax area involving legal, accounting, and technical knowledge. Our objective is to identify all facets of qualified technical activities and corresponding expenditures, leading to successful SR&ED claim completion. <br><br>  Of these, about 75% are small businesses.” (CRA RC4472). In the dynamic and varied landscape of Canadian small businesses, innovation is a necessity for survival and growth. Industrial tax credits have been part of Canada’s economic tax plan for decades, more specifically since the 1940s. “Each year the SR&ED program provides over $4 billion in investment tax credits (ITCs) to over 18,000 claimants. <br><br>  Conceptinero is a full-service grant consulting firm specializing in Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED). The higher your costs associated with SR&ED activities that are completed in Canada, the higher the percentage return from the government as an incentive for completing these activities. It is vital to find an SR&ED consultant who understands all the expenses that can be claimed and the credits that a corporation will thereby benefit from. <br><br></p><br><br><h2>Grant consulting services - Financial evaluation</h2><ul><li>Project implementation</li><li>Financial evaluation</li><li>Financial planning</li></ul></div>
