<div><p>A financial viability evaluation is also crucial.  This evaluation ensures that your game project is financially viable and has the potential for commercial success.  Many companies fail to make a SRED claim because they falsely assume that the program is restricted to “High Tech” companies.  Assigning expenses to qualifying work is a straightforward process for a professional SRED consultant.  <br><br>  SR&ED consultants often find it hard to identify what fits the definition of SR&ED.  If we can’t get tax credits from the government, we don’t get paid.  You may hear your SRED consultant refer to SR&ED as a tax credit or as a grant.  <br><br>  Unlike some larger companies, Conceptinero is a consultancy firm solely focused on SRED and we take a customized approach to each client.  As your trusted SRED advisor in Toronto and Ontario, we stay up-to-date with the latest changes in the SR&ED program and tax regulations.  There is a lot to gain from these credits and also a lot to lose if the claim is not completed correctly.  <br><br>  Federal government statistics show that 98% of credits are awarded for experimental development work (ie not classic R&D work).  For more information please call us directly at 647-299-9241.  Our success in obtaining approved SR&ED tax credit claims is a testament to our expertise and commitment to our clients.  <br><br></p></div>
