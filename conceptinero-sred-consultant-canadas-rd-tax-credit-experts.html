Trust our SRED consultants in Toronto, Ontario to navigate the complexities of the program and help you secure the tax savings you deserve. <br><br>  Choosing the right SR&ED consultant is critical as a rejected claim can be very costly not just for the foregone credits but also because it may invite further scrutiny from the CRA regarding future SR&ED claims. A taxpayer’s expenditures made for Scientific Research and Experimental Developments (SR&ED) are subject to special tax treatment that can result in recuperation of 35% of expenditures in Tax credits or Tax refunds. Like many small businesses managing your cash flow is often difficult and tricky and you may benefit from flexible arrangements with your consultant such as pay only upon the success of the SR&ED application. <br><br></p></div>

<div> <p>When it comes to making your first SR&ED claim, it's crucial to adopt a proactive approach to ensure success.  Private Canadian corporations can receive SR&ED tax credits for a substantial amount of up to 35% of qualified expenses up to the first $3 million.  The SR&ED claim consultants are also likely to understand the do’s and don’ts with regards to an application such as what red-flag words to avoid and how to formulate the project description to ensure it is compliant with the law as well as the CRA’s expectations.  The correct classification of SR&ED is that of a tax credit, however, this confuses many who falsely assume that SR&ED credits will only offset taxes payable to the government.  <br><br>  They'll work closely with you to gather all the necessary documentation and evidence required for your claim.  If you have already filed your SR&ED and are now under Audit, Conceptinero offers premium audit defense service.  Like any other profession, more experience is correlated with better knowledge and expertise in your field; hence you want to understand your perspective consultant’s background how long they have been filing SR&ED claims, and, if possible, their success track record.  <br><br>  Whether you are a start-up corporation or experienced in filing SR&ED claims, our experienced and professional consultants will minimize the disruption from your daily business operations.  Conceptinero has one line of business and one focus.  Choosing the right organization within Canada to assist with your scientific research and experimental development claim is essential for success.  <br><br>  This allows us to provide you with the most relevant and accurate information regarding your SR&ED tax credit in Toronto.
