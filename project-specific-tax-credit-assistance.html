<div> <p>A financial viability evaluation is also crucial.  This evaluation ensures that your game project is financially viable and has the potential for commercial success.  Many companies fail to make a SRED claim because they falsely assume that the program is restricted to “High Tech” companies.  Assigning expenses to qualifying work is a straightforward process for a professional SRED consultant.  <br><br>  SR&ED consultants often find it hard to identify what fits the definition of SR&ED.  If we can’t get tax credits from the government, we don’t get paid.  You may hear your SRED consultant refer to SR&ED as a tax credit or as a grant.  <br><br>  Unlike some larger companies, Conceptinero is a consultancy firm solely focused on SRED and we take a customized approach to each client.  As your trusted SRED advisor in Toronto and Ontario, we stay up-to-date with the latest changes in the SR&ED program and tax regulations.  There is a lot to gain from these credits and also a lot to lose if the claim is not completed correctly.  <br><br>  Federal government statistics show that 98% of credits are awarded for experimental development work (ie not classic R&D work).  For more information please call us directly at 647-299-9241.  Our success in obtaining approved SR&ED tax credit claims is a testament to our expertise and commitment to our clients.  <br><br></p> </div>

<div><p>If any of your employees are actively working on finding a solution for scientific research and/or solving technological problems for a solution that does not exist, then there is a great possibility that their work is partly or entirely acceptable for the SR&ED incentive. This service can be invaluable to people with complex legal structures, cross-border SRED optimization, or for start-ups and growth companies accessing VC or public funding. Look them up on the website of the Better Business Bureau or with a professional body such as CPA Ontario or CPA Canada and see if they are accredited and whether other SR&ED clients have reviews or complaints against them.<br><br><h2>Project-specific tax credit assistance - SR&ED claim assistance</h2><ol><li>SR&ED claim assistance</li><li>Regulatory requirements</li><li>Government support</li></ol> In general, if some of your staff are engaged in solving technological problems for which a solution is not readily apparent, there is a good chance that the work you are doing is fully or partially eligible for SRED credits. <br><br>  The government does not want you to have to set your SR&ED money aside in case of a future audit, instead, they want you to spend that money to hire more people and grow your business. They're well-versed in the eligibility criteria and can help you identify qualifying activities and expenditures within your game development process. When it comes to navigating the complexities of the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) program, having the expertise and guidance of a knowledgeable consultant can make all the difference in maximizing your chances of success. <br><br>  If you want to know whether you qualify for SR&ED tax credits, Conceptinero Consulting can evaluate your business. When it comes to claiming the SR&ED tax credit, having a knowledgeable SRED consultant by your side is crucial. For qualified expenses of over $3 million, private Canadian corporations can receive incentives of 15%. <br><br>  If you design new products or processes, carry out IT projects, and invest to build your stock of proprietary knowledge and best practices, you may qualify for SR&ED credits. Oftentimes at early-stage companies, the leaders and employees need to sacrifice their salary as the opportunity cost for keeping their business afloat and following their entrepreneurial dreams. Our goal is to assist you in maximizing your SR&ED tax credits in Toronto and take advantage of the benefits offered by the program. <br><br></p></div>
