If you or your organization has created a new product, improved an existing one or taken a process and made it better you may qualify. So you may prefer a consultant with a lower flat fee or some hybrid arrangement to minimize both cost and risk. We help your accountant to file a SR&ED claim on your behalf and we handle all correspondence with CRA. <br><br>  When you choose our SRED consulting services in Toronto and Ontario, you can be confident that your SR&ED claims are in capable hands. The Scientific Research & Experimental Development (SR&ED) program is the largest R&D tax incentive program in Canada. A dedicated SR&ED tax consultant is also more likely to stay on top of changing and new legislation which could have a significant impact on your SR&ED claim application and how to file it. <br><br>  This includes conducting technical interviews with your development team, reviewing project plans and progress reports, and compiling the necessary financial information. Conceptinero can guide you through the claim process, ensuring that you provide the necessary information and documentation promptly. Finally, your SRED consultant will then submit your application to the CRA and handle all post-claim administrative duties until you receive your cheque from the government. <br><br>  The SR&ED tax credit is a valuable incentive offered by the Canadian government to encourage businesses to invest in research and development. We engage with you to assess the technical and financial viability and make sure your claim gets approved by CRA with minimal audit risk. I would not hesitate to work with Kevin again.”SRED consultants play a crucial role in assisting businesses, like our Programmatic Advertising company, in navigating and maximizing benefits from the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) program. <br><br></p></div>

<div> <p>A financial viability evaluation is also crucial. This evaluation ensures that your game project is financially viable and has the potential for commercial success. Many companies fail to make a SRED claim because they falsely assume that the program is restricted to “High Tech” companies. Assigning expenses to qualifying work is a straightforward process for a professional SRED consultant. <br><br>  SR&ED consultants often find it hard to identify what fits the definition of SR&ED. If we can’t get tax credits from the government, we don’t get paid. You may hear your SRED consultant refer to SR&ED as a tax credit or as a grant. <br><br>  Unlike some larger companies, Conceptinero is a consultancy firm solely focused on SRED and we take a customized approach to each client. As your trusted SRED advisor in Toronto and Ontario, we stay up-to-date with the latest changes in the SR&ED program and tax regulations. There is a lot to gain from these credits and also a lot to lose if the claim is not completed correctly.<br><br><h2>R&D tax consulting - Technology credits</h2><ol><li>Market research</li><li>Tax implications</li><li>Tax credits</li></ol> <br><br>  Federal government statistics show that 98% of credits are awarded for experimental development work (ie not classic R&D work).

<div><p>If any of your employees are actively working on finding a solution for scientific research and/or solving technological problems for a solution that does not exist, then there is a great possibility that their work is partly or entirely acceptable for the SR&ED incentive. This service can be invaluable to people with complex legal structures, cross-border SRED optimization, or for start-ups and growth companies accessing VC or public funding. Look them up on the website of the Better Business Bureau or with a professional body such as CPA Ontario or CPA Canada and see if they are accredited and whether other SR&ED clients have reviews or complaints against them. In general, if some of your staff are engaged in solving technological problems for which a solution is not readily apparent, there is a good chance that the work you are doing is fully or partially eligible for SRED credits. <br><br>  The government does not want you to have to set your SR&ED money aside in case of a future audit, instead, they want you to spend that money to hire more people and grow your business. They're well-versed in the eligibility criteria and can help you identify qualifying activities and expenditures within your game development process. When it comes to navigating the complexities of the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) program, having the expertise and guidance of a knowledgeable consultant can make all the difference in maximizing your chances of success. <br><br>  If you want to know whether you qualify for SR&ED tax credits, Conceptinero Consulting can evaluate your business. When it comes to claiming the SR&ED tax credit, having a knowledgeable SRED consultant by your side is crucial.
